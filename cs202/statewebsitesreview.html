		<h2>1. Tennessee</h2>
		<p>
		I think the Tennessee page was the best designed page of the five because of it's simplicity in navigation and its decent design. Many of the other websites opted to add no decoration or put in a background image, which both looked poorly. Tennessee, meanwhile, keeps it simple with a blue and white color scheme and uses background images well by fitting them into the color scheme of the website, making it look less busy. Where Tennessee really stood out though was it's simple navigation and focus on getting its website's visitors where they need to be. They have drop down menus on every web page that can help them navigate the different web services, and on the home page they feature big buttons with pictures that will direct people to the services they need. Much simpler and easier to navigate than every other website on this list.

		<h2>2. West Virginia</h2>
		<p>
		I like the West Virginian website for a lot of reasons, but I think I had to give them second place because of their aesthetic design and how disjointed their different web pages are. Where the Tennessee website has persisting drop down menus to make navigating through different pages easier, when you click on a link in the West Virginian website it takes you to a completely different web page, which means that if you wanted to look at a different web page or opened the wrong webpage by mistake, you'll have to go back to the main page which is very unintuitive and could be difficult for the less tech savvy. Making your webpage easy to navigate and understand is paramount, and while West Virginia does have a good home page, all of it's other pages should also be easy to navigate from. Also, the background image on the main page looks bad and the page would be much better served with a simpler design.

		<h2>3. Montana</h2>
		<p>
		While I like the design of Montana's webpage and believe it's navigation tools to be better than that of most of these other state websites, I have to give it the bronze medal because it seems poorly organized. You click on one of the major navigation widgets and it will take you to another webpage that is just a dump of links with ambiguous titles. I'd think it'd be difficult to find the things you're looking for on the Montana website because there's no organization to the links and nothing to help describe what they do or how they can help you.		
		</p>
		
		<h2>4. South Dakota</h2>
		<p>
		The South Dakota website has a strange design. The browns and blues look very bleh, and you have this tab at the bottom that persists on every web page. It seems like it features all of the info a footer should, but it follows as you scroll covering information and providing no access to government services. I did appreciate that the South Dakota website had an organization of their link dumps, but it was still difficult to find things I was looking for. All of the background images they use also don't fit in with the websites color scheme, making them look out of place.

		<h2>5. Louisiana</h2>
		<p>
		Even at a first glance, the Louisiana site stood out as a poorly formatted and designed website. There's way too much going on with the home page, which I think would make it difficult to navigate. All of the navigation tools are super small, which would make them hard to notice among the huge mass of links. It seems like it would be difficult to find anything on this website. To clean things up, I would reorganize the links with drop down menus so the website wouldn't look so busy, and so it would be easier to find the major navigation tools. I would also put all of the news and weather forcasts on a different page or remove them eniterly, because no one is going to the state's website for news and weather, and I think they distract from the major things the website should be doing like pointing citizens in the right direction to state services.
